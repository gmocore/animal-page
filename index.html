        <p>Meercats (sp?) are rad. they are the great performers of the all the zoo creatures. Giraffes are bullshit. they are extremely active little critters, and they know how to put on a show.</p>
       
        <p>I'm typically a dog person, but meercats make my dog look boring as hell. which, in all honesty, he is. he mostly just goes undercover and sleeps. I'm doing that thing again...where i just prattle on endlessly about my dumb dog.</p>
        <p>anyway, what is left to say about meercats that hasn't already been said about (insert signaificanty pop culture reference here)</p>
